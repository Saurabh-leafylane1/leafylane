    <h2>ðŸŒ¿ LeafyLane Science</h2>

    <p>
      At LeafyLane, science meets sustainability. Our team of plant biologists, horticulturists, and eco-innovators are working behind the scenes to ensure your plants not only survive but thrive in your home environment.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>We donâ€™t just sell plants â€” we deliver life powered by science!</strong>
    </div>

    <p>
      Hereâ€™s what makes LeafyLane plants scientifically smarter:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>ðŸŒ± Soil Optimization: We use nutrient-rich, pest-resistant soil blends for maximum growth.</li>
      <li>ðŸ’§ Smart Watering Techniques: Our plants come with watering indicators and biodegradable moisture retainers.</li>
      <li>ðŸ§ª Plant Health Monitoring: Every plant is tested for health, root strength, and pest resistance before delivery.</li>
      <li>ðŸŒž Light Adaptation: Plants are matched to your homeâ€™s lighting conditions â€” low light, partial sun, or bright light.</li>
      <li>ðŸ“¦ Oxygen-Boost Promise: Each plant is selected for its air-purifying and oxygen-boosting qualities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Our mission is to make scientific plant care accessible to everyone â€” from first-time buyers to expert gardeners.
